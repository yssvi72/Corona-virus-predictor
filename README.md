In our innovative project, we employed cutting-edge machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and Linear Regression for prediction, to anticipate the spread of the Coronavirus across diverse countries. The SVM algorithm facilitated precise classification of current COVID-19 statuses in different nations, leveraging historical data for accurate assessments. Additionally, our model showcased its predictive prowess by utilizing Linear Regression to forecast the virus's trajectory for the next 10 days. This dual approach not only provided a real-time understanding of the pandemic's current state but also equipped decision-makers with valuable foresight, enabling strategic planning and intervention. Our project stands as a testament to the potential of advanced machine learning in contributing meaningfully to global efforts in addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic.
